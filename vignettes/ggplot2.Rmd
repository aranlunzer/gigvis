# ggvis vs ggplot2

If you're familiar with ggplot2, learning ggvis shouldn't be too hard - it 
borrows from many familiar concepts.  Note that ggvis is still very young,
and many of the interfaces are likely to change as we learn more about what
works well.

* Basic naming conversions: layer -> node, geom -> mark, stat -> transform, 
aes -> props, ggplot2 -> ggvis, geom + stat -> branch.

* Facetting is not currently supported, and when it is supported, it's more
  like to resemble [embedded plots](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/embedded-plots.html)
  than facetting in ggplot2.

* In ggplot2, the definition of a geom was somewhat blurred, because of things
  like `geom_histogram()` which combined `geom_bar()` with `stat_bin()`. The
  distinction is more clear in ggvis: pure geoms correspond to marks, and 
  combined geoms and stats correspond to branches.
  
* There is no equivalent to `qplot` in ggvis: you must spell out everything
  explicitly using `ggvis`.

* Vega provides a smaller set of scales than ggplot2 (just ordinal, 
  quantitative, and time), but they are much more flexible than ggplot2 scales,
  and offer equivalent functionality.

* ggplot2 has a two-level hierarchy - you have data and aes specifications in
  the plot and in each layer. ggvis provides an unlimited hierarchy - you can
  have as many levels as you need (and the data will only be computed once)
  
* ggvis makes fewer assumptions about the type of data - data does not have
  to be a data frame until it has been processed by a transform.
